This repository contains the code involved in the paper.
## Figure2_p versus iterations
The code in "Figure2_p versus iterations" is the simulation result of Figure 2.  Figure 2 shows the allocating power of 4 users versus iterations considering two different initial points under the same conditions.
## Figure3_rate versus dlink
The code in "Figure3_rate versus dlink" is the simulation result of Figure 3, which provides the results of sum rate versus the interlink distance dL. 
## Figure4_p versus EH
The code in "Figure4_p versus EH" is the simulation result of Figure 4, which shows results of the average transmit power versus the harvest energy threshold ek. In addition, Figure 4 shows the relationship between the average transmit power and the pricing factor. 
## Figure5_BER versus SINR
The code in "Figure5_BER versus SINR" is the simulation result of Figure 5, which provide results of the average bit error rate(BER) versus SINR.
